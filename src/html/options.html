				<!--This section should have more detailed controls
				 to create different themes. This should include the
				 page and the text as well as the colors of links and
				 the toolbar. Other options may include shadows on text,
				 Colors of the scrollbar or even the toolbar position or behavior.
				 The user should be fully aware that they are overriding the
				 options on the theme they have on. It should also have a span
				 that when included, will let developers know that the custom CSS
				 is overwritten by this too. That span should have an "advanced" 
				 class on it, so it will only appear if the options are in developer mode. 
				 It should also have a sample page to see what they look like.
