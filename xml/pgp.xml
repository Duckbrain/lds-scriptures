				<verse id="41912" num="5" scripture="Some time in the second year after our removal to Manchester, there was in the place where we lived an unusual excitement on the subject of religion.  It commenced with the Methodists, but soon became general among all the sects in that region of country.  Indeed, the whole district of country seemed affected by it, and great multitudes united themselves to the different religious parties, which created no small stir and division amongst the people, some crying, &quot;Lo, here!&quot; and others, &quot;Lo, there!&quot;  Some were contending for the Methodist faith, some for the Presbyterian, and some for the Baptist." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:5" title_short="JS-H 1:5" />

In process of time my mind became somewhat partial to the Methodist sect, and I felt some desire to be united with them; but so great were the confusion and strife among the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young as I was, and so unacquainted with men and things, to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:8" title_short="JS-H 1:8" />
				<verse id="41916" num="9" scripture="My mind at times was greatly excited, the cry and tumult were so great and incessant.  The Presbyterians were most decided against the Baptists and Methodists, and used all the powers of both reason and sophistry to prove their errors, or, at least, to make the people think they were in error.  On the other hand, the Baptists and Methodists in their turn were equally zealous in endeavoring to establish their own tenets and disprove all others." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:9" title_short="JS-H 1:9" />

I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:12" title_short="JS-H 1:12" />
				<verse id="41920" num="13" scripture="At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God.  I at length came to the determination to &quot;ask of God,&quot; concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:13" title_short="JS-H 1:13" />
				<verse id="41921" num="14" scripture="So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt.  It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty.  It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:14" title_short="JS-H 1:14" />
				<verse id="41922" num="15" scripture="After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God.  I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak.  Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:15" title_short="JS-H 1:15" />
				<verse id="41923" num="16" scripture="But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction--not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being--just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:16" title_short="JS-H 1:16" />
				<verse id="41924" num="17" scripture="It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound.  When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air.  One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other--This is My Beloved Son.  Hear Him!" title="Joseph Smith--History 1:17" title_short="JS-H 1:17" />
				<verse id="41925" num="18" scripture="My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join.  No sooner, therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak, than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right (for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong)--and which I should join." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:18" title_short="JS-H 1:18" />
				<verse id="41926" num="19" scripture="I was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong; and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight; that those professors were all corrupt; that: &quot;they draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.&quot;" title="Joseph Smith--History 1:19" title_short="JS-H 1:19" />
				<verse id="41927" num="20" scripture="He again forbade me to join with any of them; and many other things did he say unto me, which I cannot write at this time.  When I came to myself again, I found myself lying on my back, looking up into heaven.  When the light had departed, I had no strength; but soon recovering in some degree, I went home.  And as I leaned up to the fireplace, mother inquired what the matter was.  I replied, &quot;Never mind, all is well--I am well enough off.&quot;  I then said to my mother, &quot;I have learned for myself that Presbyterianism is not true.&quot;  It seems as though the adversary was aware, at a very early period of my life, that I was destined to prove a disturber and an annoyer of his kingdom; else why should the powers of darkness combine against me?  Why the opposition and persecution that arose against me, almost in my infancy?" title="Joseph Smith--History 1:20" title_short="JS-H 1:20" />
				<verse id="41928" num="21" scripture="Some few days after I had this vision, I happened to be in company with one of the Methodist preachers, who was very active in the before mentioned religious excitement; and, conversing with him on the subject of religion, I took occasion to give him an account of the vision which I had had.  I was greatly surprised at his behavior; he treated my communication not only lightly, but with great contempt, saying it was all of the devil, that there were no such things as visions or revelations in these days; that all such things had ceased with the apostles, and that there would never be any more of them." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:21" title_short="JS-H 1:21" />
				<verse id="41929" num="22" scripture="I soon found, however, that my telling the story had excited a great deal of prejudice against me among professors of religion, and was the cause of great persecution, which continued to increase; and though I was an obscure boy, only between fourteen and fifteen years of age, and my circumstances in life such as to make a boy of no consequence in the world, yet men of high standing would take notice sufficient to excite the public mind against me, and create a bitter persecution; and this was common among all the sects--all united to persecute me." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:22" title_short="JS-H 1:22" />
				<verse id="41930" num="23" scripture="It caused me serious reflection then, and often has since, how very strange it was that an obscure boy, of a little over fourteen years of age, and one, too, who was doomed to the necessity of obtaining a scanty maintenance by his daily labor, should be thought a character of sufficient importance to attract the attention of the great ones of the most popular sects of the day, and in a manner to create in them a spirit of the most bitter persecution and reviling.  But strange or not, so it was, and it was often the cause of great sorrow to myself." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:23" title_short="JS-H 1:23" />
				<verse id="41931" num="24" scripture="However, it was nevertheless a fact that I had beheld a vision.  I have thought since, that I felt much like Paul, when he made his defense before King Agrippa, and related the account of the vision he had when he saw a light, and heard a voice; but still there were but few who believed him; some said he was dishonest, others said he was mad; and he was ridiculed and reviled.  But all this did not destroy the reality of his vision.  He had seen a vision, he knew he had, and all the persecution under heaven could not make it otherwise; and though they should persecute him unto death, yet he knew, and would know to his latest breath, that he had both seen a light and heard a voice speaking unto him, and all the world could not make him think or believe otherwise." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:24" title_short="JS-H 1:24" />
				<verse id="41932" num="25" scripture="So it was with me.  I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me falsely for so saying, I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the truth?  I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen?  For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:25" title_short="JS-H 1:25" />
				<verse id="41933" num="26" scripture="I had now got my mind satisfied so far as the sectarian world was concerned--that it was not my duty to join with any of them, but to continue as I was until further directed.

				<verse id="41934" num="27" scripture="I continued to pursue my common vocations in life until the twenty--first of September, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three, all the time suffering severe persecution at the hands of all classes of men, both religious and irreligious, because I continued to affirm that I had seen a vision." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:27" title_short="JS-H 1:27" />
				<verse id="41935" num="28" scripture="During the space of time which intervened between the time I had the vision and the year eighteen hundred and twenty-three--having been forbidden to join any of the religious sects of the day, and being of very tender years, and persecuted by those who ought to have been my friends and to have treated me kindly, and if they supposed me to be deluded to have endeavored in a proper and affectionate manner to have reclaimed me--I was left to all kinds of temptations; and, mingling with all kinds of society, I frequently fell into many foolish errors, and displayed the weakness of youth, and the foibles of human nature; which, I am sorry to say, led me into divers temptations, offensive in the sight of God.  In making this confession, no one need suppose me guilty of any great or malignant sins.  A disposition to commit such was never in my nature.  But I was guilty of levity, and sometimes associated with jovial company, etc., not consistent with that character which ought to be maintained by one who was called of God as I had been.  But this will not seem very strange to any one who recollects my youth, and is acquainted with my native cheery temperament." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:28" title_short="JS-H 1:28" />
				<verse id="41936" num="29" scripture="In consequence of these things, I often felt condemned for my weakness and imperfections; when, on the evening of the above-mentioned twenty-first of September, after I had retired to my bed for the night, I betook myself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God for forgiveness of all my sins and follies, and also for a manifestation to me, that I might know of my state and standing before him; for I had full confidence in obtaining a divine manifestation, as I previously had one." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:29" title_short="JS-H 1:29" />

It was a whiteness beyond anything earthly I had ever seen; nor do I believe that any earthly thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant.  His hands were naked, and his arms also, a little above the wrist; so, also, were his feet naked, as were his legs, a little above the ankles.  His head and neck were also bare.  I could discover that he had no other clothing on but this robe, as it was open, so that I could see into his bosom." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:31" title_short="JS-H 1:31" />

He had heard something of a silver mine having been opened by the Spaniards in Harmony, Susquehanna county, State of Pennsylvania; and had, previous to my hiring to him, been digging, in order, if possible, to discover the mine.  After I went to live with him, he took me, with the rest of his hands, to dig for the silver mine, at which I continued to work for nearly a month, without success in our undertaking, and finally I prevailed with the old gentleman to cease digging after it.

The persecution became more bitter and severe than before, and multitudes were on the alert continually to get them from me if possible.  But by the wisdom of God, they remained safe in my hands, until I had accomplished by them what was required at my hand.

I then showed him those which were not yet translated, and he said that they were Egyptian, Chaldaic, Assyriac, and Arabic; and he said they were true characters.

				<verse id="41972" num="65" scripture="&quot;He then said to me, 'Let me see that certificate.' I accordingly took it out of my pocket and gave it to him, when he took it and tore it to pieces, saying that there was no such thing now as ministering of angels, and that if I would bring the plates to him he would translate them.  I informed him that part of the plates were sealed, and that I was forbidden to bring them.  He replied, 'I cannot read a sealed book.' I left him and went to Dr. Mitchell, who sanctioned what Professor Anthon had said respecting both the characters and the translation.&quot;" title="Joseph Smith--History 1:65" title_short="JS-H 1:65" />
				<verse id="41973" num="66" scripture="On the 5th day of April, 1829, Oliver Cowdery came to my house, until which time I had never seen him.  He stated to me that having been teaching school in the neighborhood where my father resided, and my father being one of those who sent to the school, he went to board for a season at his house, and while there the family related to him the circumstances of my having received the plates, and accordingly he had come to make inquiries of me." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:66" title_short="JS-H 1:66" />
				<verse id="41974" num="67" scripture="Two days after the arrival of Mr. Cowdery (being the 7th of April) I commenced to translate the Book of Mormon, and he began to write for me." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:67" title_short="JS-H 1:67" />
				<verse id="41975" num="68" scripture="We still continued the work of translation, when, in the ensuing month (May, 1829), we on a certain day went into the woods to pray and inquire of the Lord respecting baptism for the remission of sins, that we found mentioned in the translation of the plates.  While we were thus employed, praying and calling upon the Lord, a messenger from heaven descended in a cloud of light, and having laid his hands upon us, he ordained us, saying:" title="Joseph Smith--History 1:68" title_short="JS-H 1:68" />
				<verse id="41976" num="69" scripture="Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:69" title_short="JS-H 1:69" />
				<verse id="41977" num="70" scripture="He said this Aaronic Priesthood had not the power of laying on hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, but that this should be conferred on us hereafter; and he commanded us to go and be baptized, and gave us directions that I should baptize Oliver Cowdery, and that afterwards he should baptize me." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:70" title_short="JS-H 1:70" />
				<verse id="41978" num="71" scripture="Accordingly we went and were baptized. I baptized him first, and afterwards he baptized me--after which I laid my hands upon his head and ordained him to the Aaronic Priesthood, and afterwards he laid his hands on me and ordained me to the same Priesthood--for so we were commanded." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:71" title_short="JS-H 1:71" />
				<verse id="41979" num="72" scripture="The messenger who visited us on this occasion and conferred this Priesthood upon us, said that his name was John, the same that is called John the Baptist in the New Testament, and that he acted under the direction of Peter, James and John, who held the keys of the Priesthood of Melchizedek, which Priesthood, he said, would in due time be conferred on us, and that I should be called the first Elder of the Church, and he (Oliver Cowdery) the second.  It was on the fifteenth day of May, 1829, that we were ordained under the hand of this messenger, and baptized." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:72" title_short="JS-H 1:72" />
				<verse id="41980" num="73" scripture="Immediately on our coming up out of the water after we had been baptized, we experienced great and glorious blessings from our Heavenly Father.  No sooner had I baptized Oliver Cowdery, than the Holy Ghost fell upon him, and he stood up and prophesied many things which should shortly come to pass.  And again, so soon as I had been baptized by him, I also had the spirit of prophecy, when, standing up, I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church, and many other things connected with the Church, and this generation of the children of men.  We were filled with the Holy Ghost, and rejoiced in the God of our salvation." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:73" title_short="JS-H 1:73" />
				<verse id="41981" num="74" scripture="Our minds being now enlightened, we began to have the scriptures laid open to our understandings, and the true meaning and intention of their more mysterious passages revealed unto us in a manner which we never could attain to previously, nor ever before had thought of.  In the meantime we were forced to keep secret the circumstances of having received the Priesthood and our having been baptized, owing to a spirit of persecution which had already manifested itself in the neighborhood." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:74" title_short="JS-H 1:74" />
				<verse id="41982" num="75" scripture="We had been threatened with being mobbed, from time to time, and this, too, by professors of religion.  And their intentions of mobbing us were only counteracted by the influence of my wife's father's family (under Divine providence), who had become very friendly to me, and who were opposed to mobs, and were willing that I should be allowed to continue the work of translation without interruption; and therefore offered and promised us protection from all unlawful proceedings, as far as in them lay." title="Joseph Smith--History 1:75" title_short="JS-H 1:75" />
